If a very large sparse matrix is stored in normal array format, a huge amount of memory will be needed to store values that are almost all zero. Instead, large sparse matrices are normally stored in a compacted form, where only the non-zero values are stored. Coordinate format is a very simple representation of a sparse matrix, where each non-zero value is stored alongside its row and column index. Perhaps the most widely-used sparse matrix representation is compressed sparse row (CSR), where non-zero values from the same row are grouped together, and each non-zero value is stored with its corresponding column index. A fundamental operation on matrices is transpose, where the row and column indices of each non-zero value are swapped. The transpose of a sparse matrix in CSR format can be computed extremely efficiently if it is computed out-of-place, that is the values are copied from the original matrix to a new matrix in a different memory location. However, sparse matrices that are used to solve systems of equations are often extremely large, and there is often not enough memory for both the original and transposed copy. There are big advantages of any approach that can do an in-place transpose, that is transpose the matrix within the memory of the original sparse matrix. For an N x N sparse matrix in CSR format with Z non-zero values, Saad’s algorithm can compute an in-place sparse matrix transpose in O(Z + N) time, and using O(Z + N) additional temporary space. Crosbie and Gregg’s algorithm computes the in-place transpose in O(Z + N) time and requires O(N) additional temporary space. The goal of the project is to evaluate algorithmic improvements for the in-place transpose that reduce the execution time. A key aspect of this project is measuring the practical reductions in execution time due to algorithmic improvements.

The coast is a critical junction for environmental settings, human activities, infrastructure, and sensitive ecosystems, making coastal erosion a pressing concern. Ireland’s coastline features both rock-dominated and soft sediment coasts, with erosion rates varying markedly according to the geological setting and the overall energy regime of the coast. Particularly vulnerable are the unconsolidated, soft, and low-lying coasts, which are already experiencing erosion, flooding, and ecosystem losses. Dublin’s coastline is primarily underlain by limestones, shales, and more resistant granites and metasediments, with soft sediments largely covering coastal areas. Coastal erosion is influenced by global processes such as sea-level rise (SLR) and local conditions. Climate change exacerbates these issues, leading to increased erosion, flooding, and ecosystem losses. Rising sea levels and more frequent extreme sea-level events are expected to have profound impacts on communities and infrastructure along the Irish coast. Projections indicate that these changes could affect up to 2 million people living within 5 km of the coast and critical infrastructure. The project aims to utilize data available on the GSI’s website (and Sentinel satellite images) to build a machine learning model that can predict coastal erosion.

The encountered nodes store the messages in theirbuffer using the store-carry-forward approach until they encounter another node or reach thedestination.

Sorting networks are made up of hardware comparator units connected together by a fixed network of wires so that the outputs of one comparator can become an input to another. Sorting networks can be implemented in hardware or software. Sorting networks can be a particularly useful abstraction for modelling sorting routines that are implemented by vector instructions. The deterministic sequence of comparisons and conditional swaps used in sorting networks typically map well to branchless sequences of vector instructions. A common strategy for creating sorting routines with vector instructions is to first design the sorting network, and then to implement the sorting network using vector instructions. This approach works pretty well, but it could be better. The problem is that vector instructions operate on L adjacent lanes (for typical values of L such as 4, 8 or 16). Ideally, the sequence of comparisons in the sorting network can be mapped directly to these vector instructions. However, in many cases the sequence of comparisons expressed by the sorting network does not involve simple sequences of elements to be compared. To implement these parts of the sorting network, additional swizzle operations are needed, to shuffle, permute and blend the vectors to align the values correctly in the vectors. The goal of this project is to develop software that can automatically generate sorting networks that are optimized for vector instructions. There are existing sorting network generator programs that search for sorting networks that use fewer comparators, or fewer levels of parallel comparators. Examples include SorterHunter (https://github.com/bertdobbelaere/SorterHunter).

These manipulations can vary from subtle changes to sophisticated fabrications, posing challenges for both human observers and automated systems in distinguishing between authentic and falsified footage. Figure illustrates the facial and foreground/background manipulations.The consequences of undetected deepfakes in video surveillance are far-reaching, potentially resulting in serious outcomes such as wrongful accusations, compromised security operations, and a decline in public trust in surveillance technologies. Incidents such as the spread of deepfakes of Barack Obama, famous singer Taylor Swift, and many more, caused alarming chaos in social media, reducing the trust in the content.

Modern large language models (LLMs) are trained by masking out words in text and asking the model to guess the missing word.  This suggests that these models might also perform well at reconstructing redacted text, and this is what you will investigate in this project.  You’ll look at various bodies of sensitive text (medical, political etc), apply various redaction tools and then try to “attack” the redacted text by using an LLM to reconstruct the redacted words.  It is likely that some parts of speak will be easier to reconstruct than others, and that the reconstruction performance will vary depending on how similar the unredacted text is to the text used to train the LLM.  You will therefore also look at fine-tuning the LLM to your body of text and explore how that impacts reconstruction performance. If time permits, we will look at whether these LLM reconstruction attacks can be used to improve the way that redaction is carried out so as to make it less sensitive to such attacks.

With the increasing availability of large-scale networking datasets, there is a unique opportunity to leverage machine learning (ML) techniques to automatically discover and classify these mobility patterns, leading to more accurate and adaptive models.

Experiments designed to test this typically have species diversity manipulated across field-scale plots, with a plot-level response such as harvested yield measured. The relationship between species diversity and the response is then modelled. There are multiple statistical methods that can be used to analyse this relationship. Some rely on using the number of species sown in the plot as a predictor in a regression model, while others use the identity of the species sown and their proportions, in addition to the number of species. This project will investigate data from a published paper; in the paper, the statistical method used relied on the number of species as the measure of species diversity. The work in this project, will be to apply and compare alternative statistical methods of assessing the species diversity – response relationships to determine the impact of the various statistical approaches on inference.', '{Statistics,Statistics and Sustainability,Sustainability,Data Analytics,Data Visualisation,Machine Learning,Species Diversity}', 'Available',

But, various weather degradation factors such as rain and snow streaks, along with atmospheric veil severely affect the perceptual quality of an image, eventually affecting the performance of these applications. There exist weather specific (rain, haze, snow, etc .) methods focusing on respective restoration task. As image restoration is a preprocessing step for high level surveillance applications, it is practically inapplicable to have different architectures for different weather restoration. In this paper, we propose a lightweight unified network, having 1.1M parameters (1 / 40 th and 1 / 6 th of the existing state-of-the-art rain with veil removal, and snow with veil removal methods respectively) for removal of rain and snow along with the veiling effect present in the images. In this network, we propose two parallel streams to handle the degradations and restoration: First, degradation removal stream (DRS) focuses mainly on removing randomly repeating degradations i.e., rain and snow streaks, through the proposed adaptive multi-scale feature sharing block (AMFSB) and stage-wise subtractive block (SSB). Second, feature corrector stream (FCS) mainly focuses on refining the partial outputs of the first stream, reducing the veiling effect and acts supplementary to the first stream.

Traditional centralized control methods often struggle to cope with the dynamic nature of these networks, particularly in environments with a dense deployment of small cells. These cells, which serve as the backbone of integrated access and backhaul (IAB) systems, are critical for extending coverage and enhancing capacity in urban areas. However, managing these networks effectively requires solutions that can adapt in real-time, optimize performance autonomously, and reduce the operational costs associated with network maintenance. Agent-based modeling (ABM) offers a promising approach to address these challenges by simulating the behavior of individual network elements as autonomous agents capable of self-organization. By allowing each agent to make local decisions based on its environment and interactions with neighboring agents, ABM can mimic the distributed nature of modern communication networks. This approach can lead to more resilient and adaptive networks, where optimization happens at a local level, reducing the need for extensive centralized control. In this context, the proposed project aims to develop an ABM simulation tool to explore and enhance self-organization mechanisms in communication networks, with a focus on optimizing latency and IAB performance in small cell deployments. The primary goal of this project is to design and implement an agent-based modeling simulation tool that will allow us to study and improve self-organization in communication networks.
